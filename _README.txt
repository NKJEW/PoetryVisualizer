Poetry Visualizer

Plans:
- React for Frontend
- NodeJS (basically goes with React), interacts with python
- Python to do word anaylsis (using 'pronouncing' library to count syllables, meter, find rhymes)


Features:
- syllable tracking (show remaining in syllables in margins, or show how many syllables in your line)
- rhyme visualization and suggestion

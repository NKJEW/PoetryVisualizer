Poetry Visualizer

Plans:
- React for Frontend
- NodeJS (basically goes with React), interacts with python
- Python to do word anaylsis (using 'pronouncing' library to count syllables, meter, find rhymes)


Features:
- syllable tracking (show remaining in syllables in margins, or show how many syllables in your line)
- rhyme visualization and suggestion

Flow:
At the start, you choose a poem structure or no structure
In the margins, each line has a syllable count (possibly as a fraction for the structure)
In the margins, each line shows the rhyme structure (e.g. ABAABBABABABABABAB)
Rhyme suggestions - and option to override a rhyme
Each word shows the stressed unstressed syllables above it
Option to manually set stressed/unstressed
